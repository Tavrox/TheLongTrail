An open source game about running to show my coding skills.

You play as a jogger and need to find a balance between energy, sprint and endurance to last the longest possible.

Coded by Tavrox aka Yannick Elahee, indie game designer & game developer looking for jobs.

Uses only assets and libraries from the unity asset store. Beware of some licences tough, I haven't checked them.
Feel free to report to me if you think some codes / assets should be removed from this directory.
